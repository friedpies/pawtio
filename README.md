## Pawtio
[Deployed Link](https://pawtio.herokuapp.com/)

A web-app to help you find a place to hang out and chill with your pup in Austin, TX!

### Description
One huge perk of living in Austin, TX is that almost everything is dog friendly! You can bring your dog to most bars and restaurants, provided that you sit outside on the patio. Unfortunately, it get's really hot during the summer. Using a resource like bringfido.com doesn't make much sense, since it's less about finding IF a place is dog friendly, but rather HOW dog friendly it is. For example, most bars and restaurants don't let dogs inside, but some do, and there's no resource out that gives you details. That's where pawtio comes into play! Using a selection of filters, pawtio will help you narrow down your search so you can find a nice place to relax with your dog!

### Tech Stack
This app was built with React, Express, and MongoDB and is deployed with Docker on a Digital Ocean Droplet.
